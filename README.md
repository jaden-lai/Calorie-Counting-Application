# Daily Calorie Counting Application

## What will the application do?

This application will consist of multiple parts:
- **Main UI** *screen*: Total recommended calorie goal displayed and ability to modify calories, food consumption, 
and fitness.

This calorie counting application will allow users to calorie count through their daily activities from food consumption,
to fitness. A user's 'target' calorie goal will be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation based off
user-inputed information about themselves such as height and body weight; they will be able to modify this target based on
their goals.


## Who will use it?

This application aims to help those trying to gain, lose, or maintain their weight by tracking calories to assist the user
in establishing a calorie surplus, calorie deficit, or to meet whatever goals the user may have in mind in regards to bodyweight.



## Why is this project of interest to you?

I began going to the gym on a daily just last year, and became very interested in fitness and bodybuilding. It
all started when a friend invited me to train before it became something I was passionate about. It's become a part
of my day-to-day routine, something that gives me confidence, and a new medium to bond with others over. The importance of
calorie counting in bodybuilding is substantial. Even though there's a surplus amount of calorie counting and fitness apps,
I think it would be interesting to tackle this and create one of my own.
