# Tile Memory Matching Game

## What will the application do?

I imagine the game to consist of three parts
- **Start** *screen*
- **Game** *screen*
- **Loss** *screen*

The start screen will provide instructions on how to play the game,
a start button, and a high score counter.

The game screen will consist of a grid of square tiles, a score counter, and a pause button.
It begins with a grid of blank 10 x 10 squares at one flashing tile. Once that tile flashes, the player must
click the same tile after it goes blank again. If they are correct, two tiles will flash next, n + 1 tiles where n is 
the previous number of flashing tiles. If incorrect, high score will be checked and updated if beaten. 
The player wins if they reach n = 90 flashing tiles.

The loss screen will be displayed if an incorrect tile is selected, projecting the game-score as well as
the current high score. It will also include a play again, or return to start screen button.




## Who will use it?

This project is a video game so its application will be solely for user
entertainment. It should be an easy pick-up game that users of all ages
can enjoy.



## Why is this project of interest to you?

I grew up playing many video games. Many role-playing games 
I enjoyed required players to solve mini-game-like puzzles to progress the storyline. 
\ think it will be interesting to re-create a puzzle-like memory game as well.
