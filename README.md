# Daily Calorie Counting Application

## What will the application do?

This application will consist of multiple parts:

- **Main UI** *screen*: Target calorie and calorie counter displayed with ability to modify calories, food consumption,
  and fitness.

This calorie counting application will allow users to calorie count through their daily activities from food
consumption, to fitness. A user's 'target' calorie goal will be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation based off
user-inputted information about themselves such as height and body weight; they will be able to modify this target based
on their goals.

NOTE: The UI presented in this application references the 'Teller App' and 'JsonSerializationDemo' closely provided in
CPSC 210.

## Who will use it?

This application aims to help those trying to gain, lose, or maintain their weight by tracking calories to establish a
calorie surplus, deficit, or maintenance to meet the user's goals.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I committed myself to the gym 5-6 days a week since the October of 2021, growing a passion for fitness and bodybuilding.
It's become an integral part of my day-to-day life Anyone who bodybuilds knows the importance of calorie counting and
its significance in controlling body weight and body fat. There are many calorie and weight tracking apps out there
today. However, I think it would be interesting to tackle this as my first project and attempt creating one of my own.
