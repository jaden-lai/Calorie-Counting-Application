# My Honeycomb Memory Game Project

## What will the application do?

I imagine the game to consist of three parts
- **Start** *screen*
- **Game** *screen*
- **Loss** *screen*

The start screen will provide instructions on how to play the game,
a start button, a high score counter, and an options button to control sound.

The game screen will consist of a level counter, lives counter, a pause button, and the game itself.
The game start with a board of hexagons in a 'honeycomb' structure. It will begin with
a hexagon flashing once, which will then require the user to click that hexagon. If they
are correct, they will progress to the next level, which will add another flashing hexagon. If incorrect,
they will remain at the same level and lose a life. The number of hexagons will increase as the user progresses
through the levels until all lives are lost, at which the score will either replace the current high score, or do nothing.

The loss screen will be displayed when all lives are lost, projecting the game-score as well as
the current high score. It will also include a play again, or return to start screen button.




## Who will use it?

This project is a video game so its application will be solely for user
entertainment. It should be an easy pick-up game that users of all ages
can enjoy.



## Why is this project of interest to you?

I grew up playing many video games. Many role-playing games 
I enjoyed required players to solve mini-game-like puzzles to progress the storyline. 
\ think it will be interesting to re-create a puzzle-like memory game as well.
